Student Placement Prediction Model


Overview
This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict student placements. The model uses various features such as academic performance, extracurricular activities, and other relevant factors to predict the likelihood of a student being placed in a company.

Objectives
To preprocess and clean the student data.
To explore and analyze the data for insightful patterns.
To build and evaluate a machine learning model using train-test split.
To provide an interface for making predictions.
Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing data distributions, correlations, and key trends.
Model Building: Implementing a machine learning model using train-test split for training and evaluation.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the model based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Prediction Interface: A simple interface for making predictions.
Technologies Used
Python: For data analysis and machine learning.
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Scikit-Learn: For implementing and evaluating the machine learning model.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
